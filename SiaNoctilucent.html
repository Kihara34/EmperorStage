                        <h2>Lore</h2>
                        <p >
                            Receiving the grace from the holy land, her intelligence, learning ability, and cleverness are undoubtedly a beautiful gift from “Sanctuary Land” , being a talented leader and an outstanding intelligence has given her a firm position on the 13th seat from a very young age<br>
                            During this time, thanks to her contributions to Golden Loyal in terms of magical knowledge and research on individual graces, she received a "Reflection" a royal guard from the Mirror of Purity, who would protect her but also be a way for Golden Loyal to spy on her, little did they know that Sia's grace was enough to resist reflections and that her "Reflection" was also one of the thousand Special "Reflections"<br>
                            But to say that for her, those expectations were like chains that bound her from the path of freedom. Everything in this "holy land" in her eyes became increasingly gray and meaningless. Those in this council only knew how to enjoy pleasure and wear a mask of despicable hypocrisy. The people here were no less than those arrogant people, considering themselves a superior species. It was truly a shame.<br>
                            what she contributed was almost nothing but exploitation, and her parents kept on mouthing those same sickeningly sweet words, repeating over and over again "This is good for you" "you do this for the people! and for our land! Why can’t you see it dear!?”<br>
                            Her era was a time of conflict between Demons and Saintmens, rebellion and chaos engulfed the two lands, when force was not enough, those in the council decided to use her as a pawn on the chessboard and of course she was smart enough to realize it.<br>
                            Under the pressure of the council and the indifference of her parents, she was forced to marry Normaderen - the Demon Lord to ease the situation, creating a fake "peace" to give the forces of the "Sanctuary Land” enough time to launch a total destruction on the Demon Realm, of course they would not hesitate that she could be killed if the plan was exposed, what an ungrateful bunch, she pleaded with her parents as well as presented her reasoning to the council but no one listened to her, that's why she realized that now no one could stand up for her except herself.<br>
                            Knowing that this would not go anywhere, knowing that even if she married him, peace would not exist, she single-handedly planned to murder Normaderen and also staged her own murder by someone else, she gave Colofa the "Blade of The Dark Moon Fall" which was enough to kill an Empyreans like Normaderen, before carrying out this plan she gave her last command to her loyal "Reflection" - Colofa, that "Please forget all of this and please my dear…bring heaven to earth for me" then poured her grace on Colofa's Spirit and committed suicide…staging her death as an assassination<br>
                            After that event Normaderen was severely injured with wounds that could not heal but he did not die, Sia was found dead at "Sia's Tower of Urgence", Colofa carried Sia's grace, forgetting everything... her personality mutated according to Sia's indescribable sadness and an extreme ideology with "bringing heaven to earth" similar to killing ALL demons, the loss of both sides caused the war between the two sides to stop leaving the council and her parents in shock and the wound that could not heal for Noramderen, "Blade of The Dark Moon Fall" was then given to Charlotte as part of the agreement between them.

                        <li><p>She did create a resistance army that was secretly commanded under her command, often conferring at the "Blessed to The Apple Fall" they mainly caused chaos in the central areas of "Sanctuary Land" against the Council of 12 and encouraged the people to oppose the plan, unfortunately this army did not operate for long because they were later suppressed and a few were able to escape from the reach of the Council of 12.</p></li>
                        <li><p>She created “Nocturnus”, a magic specialized to inflict heavy damage on Demons and Demans</p></li>
                        <li><p>She created a place called “Blessing of The Apple Fall” which created an entire ecosystem and a safe haven for the outcasts, sheltered under her arms, of course such an ideal place was completely hidden from the eyes of the Sanctieus Council.</p></li>
